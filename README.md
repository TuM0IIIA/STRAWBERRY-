    # STRAWBERRY shop
    #### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDaqZDbdWM4
    #### Description:

Use python project.py
and follow the recommendations

This is the website for selling the strawberry in a chocolate.
there are several pages with goods:
-main (index)
-catalogue (products)
-single product review (single_product)

website is creeaeted to show the product to the customers
and riderect the customer to the messendger

Why we didn't implement the cart and payment -
due to the legislation it is more cheap if the client will transfer the money from card to card

to manage the site (pictures and info about the products) we have a database
where we can adjust the goods according to our requerements

we have a feedback page - for companies and wholesale purchases from us

the project wasn't easy at all ) for instance I spend two days tried to solve a problem with a bug created due to the typed mistake in the  migration file
and due to the error in the previous migrations I can't created a new one.

I started to understand frontend , database and  requests and answers from the website.

Additional test block was specified like separate to highlighted it.
I realized how to store database info via fixture and provide database tests based on it.
first I set folder for images in the static folder. but after I realized that much more interesting and convenient to upload photos in real time and store them in database

When you wrote "In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you might expect." You were terrebly right writing that.
Even now my site has many bugs and I have many ideas how to improve it.

The best result will be implementing of this pattern as a real website and include an additional features.
I would like to create a telegram bot for it.
For instance this website will redirect the user to the bot
And bot will ask an additional info about the colours, chocolate, appearance and delivery district.
Why messengers - there are much more people using phones to surf internet due to convenience of carrying them everywhere.

And once again I would like to thank you. It was terribly hard and unbelievable interesting!
