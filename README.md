This is the website for selling the strawberry in a chocolate.
there are several pages with goods:
-main (index)
-catalogue (products)
-single product review (single_product)

website is created to show the product to the customers
and riderect the customer to the messendger

Why we didn't implement the cart and payment -
due to the legislation it is more cheap if the client will transfer the money from card to card

to manage the site (pictures and info about the products) we have a database
where we can adjust the goods according to our requerements

we have a feedback page - for companies and wholesale purchases from us
